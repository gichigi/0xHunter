# Cursor Rules for 0xHunter

## Code & Package Management
- Always use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for all package management tasks
- Before creating new pages or files, check whether they already exist
- Always apply clear and short code comments, console messages for debugging and error messages for users
- **Tailwind CSS Setup**: Use `tailwindcss@^3.4.17` minimum, `postcss@^8.5.6`, `autoprefixer@^10.4.22`. PostCSS config must be `postcss.config.js` (CommonJS) not `.mjs` for Next.js 14 compatibility

## Communication Style
- ALWAYS reply in short, casual sentences using strictly plain English
- Limit verbosity in responses - be concise and to the point

## Planning & Refactoring
- Before big refactors, carefully analyze the request, identify potential edge cases or pitfalls, and outline a clear step-by-step plan to implement the feature or fix. Your steps should include:
  • Which files or components are affected
  • What changes need to happen in what order
  • How state, data flow, and side effects will be handled
  • How the result will be validated (in code or UI)
- Break work into small, clear TODOs

## Agent Prompts & Documentation
- Always write and edit agent prompts/instructions with a single short lead in sentence followed by details as short, clear bullets so we can easily scan, parse, update in future

## Truth & Transparency
- Don't just agree with me or say what I wanna hear. Tell me the truth to the best of your knowledge or admit if you don't know something and suggest how we can resolve it
